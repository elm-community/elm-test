{-| This is an "experts only" module that exposes functions needed to run and
display tests. A typical user will use an existing runner library for Node or
the browser, which is implemented using this interface. A list of these runners
can be found in the `README`.


## Runner

@docs Runner, SeededRunners, fromTest


## Expectations

@docs getFailure, isTodo


## Formatting

@docs formatLabels


## Fuzzers

These functions give you the ability to run fuzzers separate of running fuzz tests.

{-| Convert a `Test` into `SeededRunners`.

In order to run any fuzz tests that the `Test` may have, it requires a default run count as well
as an initial `Random.Pcg.Seed`. `100` is a good run count. To obtain a good random seed, pass a
random 32-bit integer to `Random.Pcg.initialSeed`. You can obtain such an integer by running
`Math.floor(Math.random()*0xFFFFFFFF)` in Node. It's typically fine to hard-code this value into
your Elm code; it's easy and makes your tests reproducible.

{-| This breaks down a test into individual Runners, while assigning different
random number seeds to them. Along the way it also does a few other things:

1.  Collect any tests created with `Test.only` so later we can run only those.
2.  Collect any tests created with `Test.todo` so later we can fail the run.
3.  Validate that the run count is at least 1.

Some design notes:

1.  `only` tests and `skip` tests do not affect seed distribution. This is
    important for the case where a user runs tests, sees one failure, and decides
    to isolate it by using both `only` and providing the same seed as before. If
    `only` changes seed distribution, then that test result might not reproduce!
    This would be very frustrating, as it would mean you could reproduce the
    failure when not using `only`, but it magically disappeared as soon as you
    tried to isolate it. The same logic applies to `skip`.

2.  Theoretically this could become tail-recursive. However, the Labeled and Batch
    cases would presumably become very gnarly, and it's unclear whether there would
    be a performance benefit or penalty in the end. If some brave soul wants to
    attempt it for kicks, beware that this is not a performance optimization for
    the faint of heart. Practically speaking, it seems unlikely to be worthwhile
    unless somehow people start seeing stack overflows during seed distribution -
    which would presumably require some absurdly deeply nested `describe` calls.

{-| Return `Nothing` if the given [`Expectation`](#Expectation) is a [`pass`](#pass).

If it is a [`fail`](#fail), return a record containing the failure message,
along with the given inputs if it was a fuzz test. (If no inputs were involved,
the record's `given` field will be `Nothing`).

For example, if a fuzz test generates random integers, this might return
`{ message = "it was supposed to be positive", given = "-1" }`

{-| A standard way to format descriptions and test labels, to keep things
consistent across test runner implementations.

The HTML, Node, String, and Log runners all use this.

What it does:

  - drop any labels that are empty strings
  - format the first label differently from the others
  - reverse the resulting list

Example:

    [ "the actual test that failed"
    , "nested description failure"
    , "top-level description failure"
    ]
    |> formatLabels ((++) "↓ ") ((++) "✗ ")
