## Basic Expectations

@docs Expectation, equal, notEqual, all


## Numeric Comparisons

@docs lessThan, atMost, greaterThan, atLeast


## Floating Point Comparisons

These functions allow you to compare `Float` values up to a specified rounding error, which may be relative, absolute,
or both. For an in-depth look, see our [Guide to Floating Point Comparison](#guide-to-floating-point-comparison).

@docs FloatingPointTolerance, within, notWithin


## Booleans

@docs true, false


## Collections

@docs err, equalLists, equalDicts, equalSets


## Customizing

These functions will let you build your own expectations.

@docs pass, fail, onFail


## Guide to Floating Point Comparison

In general, if you are multiplying, you want relative tolerance, and if you're adding,
you want absolute tolerance. If you are doing both, you want both kinds of tolerance,
or to split the calculation into smaller parts for testing.


### Absolute Tolerance

Let's say we want to figure out if our estimation of pi is precise enough.

Is `3.14` within `0.01` of `pi`? Yes, because `3.13 < pi < 3.15`.

    test "3.14 approximates pi with absolute precision" <| \_ ->
        3.14 |> Expect.within (Absolute 0.01) pi


### Relative Tolerance

What if we also want to know if our circle circumference estimation is close enough?

Let's say our circle has a radius of `r` meters. The formula for circle circumference is `C=2*r*pi`.
To make the calculations a bit easier ([ahem](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto)), we'll look at half the circumference; `C/2=r*pi`.
Is `r * 3.14` within `0.01` of `r * pi`?
That depends, what does `r` equal? If `r` is `0.01`mm, or `0.00001` meters, we're comparing
`0.00001 * 3.14 - 0.01 < r * pi < 0.00001 * 3.14 + 0.01` or `-0.0099686 < 0.0000314159 < 0.0100314`.
That's a huge tolerance! A circumference that is _a thousand times longer_ than we expected would pass that test!

On the other hand, if `r` is very large, we're going to need many more digits of pi.
For an absolute tolerance of `0.01` and a pi estimation of `3.14`, this expectation only passes if `r < 2*pi`.

If we use a relative tolerance of `0.01` instead, the circle area comparison becomes much better. Is `r * 3.14` within
`1%` of `r * pi`? Yes! In fact, three digits of pi approximation is always good enough for a 0.1% relative tolerance,
as long as `r` isn't [too close to zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number).

    fuzz
        (floatRange 0.000001 100000)
        "Circle half-circumference with relative tolerance"
        (\r -> r * 3.14 |> Expect.within (Relative 0.001) (r * pi))


### Trouble with Numbers Near Zero

If you are adding things near zero, you probably want absolute tolerance. If you're comparing values between `-1` and `1`, you should consider using absolute tolerance.

For example: Is `1 + 2 - 3` within `1%` of `0`? Well, if `1`, `2` and `3` have any amount of rounding error, you might not get exactly zero. What is `1%` above and below `0`? Zero. We just lost all tolerance. Even if we hard-code the numbers, we might not get exactly zero; `0.1 + 0.2` rounds to a value just above `0.3`, since computers, counting in binary, cannot write down any of those three numbers using a finite number of digits, just like we cannot write `0.333...` exactly in base 10.

Another example is comparing values that are on either side of zero. `0.0001` is more than `100%` away from `-0.0001`. In fact, `infinity` is closer to `0.0001` than `0.0001` is to `-0.0001`, if you are using a relative tolerance. Twice as close, actually. So even though both `0.0001` and `-0.0001` could be considered very close to zero, they are very far apart relative to each other. The same argument applies for any number of zeroes.
