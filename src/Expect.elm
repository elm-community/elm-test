module Expect exposing (Expectation, pass, fail, getFailure, equal, notEqual, atMost, lessThan, greaterThan, atLeast, true, false, onFail)

{-| A library to create `Expectation`s, which describe a claim to be tested.

## Quick Reference

* [`equal`](#equal) `(arg2 == arg1)`
* [`notEqual`](#notEqual) `(arg2 /= arg1)`
* [`lessThan`](#lessThan) `(arg2 < arg1)`
* [`atMost`](#atMost) `(arg2 <= arg1)`
* [`greaterThan`](#greaterThan) `(arg2 > arg1)`
* [`atLeast`](#atLeast) `(arg2 >= arg1)`
* [`true`](#true) `(arg == True)`
* [`false`](#false) `(arg == False)`

## Basic Expectations

@docs Expectation, equal, notEqual

## Comparisons

@docs lessThan, atMost, greaterThan, atLeast

## Booleans

@docs true, false

## Customizing

@docs pass, fail, onFail, getFailure

{-| The result of a single test run: either a [`pass`](#pass) or a
[`fail`](#fail).

type alias Expectation =
    Test.Expectation.Expectation


{-| Passes if the arguments are equal.

    Expect.equal 0 (List.length [])

    -- Passes because (0 == 0) is True

Failures resemble code written in pipeline style, so you can tell
which argument is which:

    -- Fails because the expected value didn't split the space in "Betty Botter"
    String.split " " "Betty Botter bought some butter"
        |> Expect.equal [ "Betty Botter", "bought", "some", "butter" ]

    ╵
    [ "Betty Botter", "bought", "some", "butter" ]

    -}
-}
equal : a -> a -> Expectation
equal =
    compareWith "Expect.equal" (==)


{-| Passes if the arguments are not equal.

    -- Passes because (11 /= 100) is True
    90 + 10
        |> Expect.notEqual 11


    -- Fails because (100 /= 100) is False
    90 + 10
        |> Expect.notEqual 100

    100

notEqual : a -> a -> Expectation
notEqual =
    compareWith "Expect.notEqual" (/=)


{-| Passes if the second argument is less than the first.

    Expect.lessThan 1 (List.length [])

    -- Passes because (0 < 1) is True

Failures resemble code written in pipeline style, so you can tell
which argument is which:

    -- Fails because (0 < -1) is False
    List.length []
        |> Expect.lessThan -1

{-| Passes if the second argument is less than or equal to the first.

    Expect.atMost 1 (List.length [])

    -- Passes because (0 <= 1) is True

Failures resemble code written in pipeline style, so you can tell
which argument is which:

    -- Fails because (0 <= -3) is False
    List.length []
        |> Expect.atMost -3

    {-

{-| Passes if the second argument is greater than the first.

    Expect.greaterThan -2 List.length []

    -- Passes because (0 > -2) is True

Failures resemble code written in pipeline style, so you can tell
which argument is which:

    -- Fails because (0 > 1) is False
    List.length []
        |> Expect.greaterThan 1

    {-

    0

greaterThan : comparable -> comparable -> Expectation
greaterThan =
    compareWith "Expect.greaterThan" (>)


{-| Passes if the second argument is greater than or equal to the first.

    Expect.atLeast -2 (List.length [])

    -- Passes because (0 >= -2) is True

Failures resemble code written in pipeline style, so you can tell
which argument is which:

    -- Fails because (0 >= 3) is False
    List.length []
        |> Expect.atLeast 3

    {-

{-| Passes if the argument is 'True', and otherwise fails with the given message.

    Expect.true "Expected the list to be empty." (List.isEmpty [])

    -- Passes because (List.isEmpty []) is True

Failures resemble code written in pipeline style, so you can tell
which argument is which:

    -- Fails because List.isEmpty returns False, but we expect True.
    List.isEmpty [ 42 ]
        |> Expect.true "Expected the list to be empty."

    {-

    Expected the list to be empty.

{-| Passes if the argument is 'False', and otherwise fails with the given message.

    Expect.false "Expected the list not to be empty." (List.isEmpty [ 42 ])

    -- Passes because (List.isEmpty [ 42 ]) is False

Failures resemble code written in pipeline style, so you can tell
which argument is which:

    -- Fails because (List.isEmpty []) is True
    List.isEmpty []

For example, if a fuzz test generates random integers, this might return
`{ message = "it was supposed to be positive", given = "-1" }`
