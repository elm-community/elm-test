{-| A type to describe how close a floating point number must be to the expected value for the test to pass. This may be
specified as absolute or relative. If you're not deeply familiar with binary floating point, you probably want `Absolute`.

want a logical AND, use [`Expect.all`](#all).

{-| Passes if the second and third arguments are equal within a relative tolerance
specified by the first argument. This is intended to avoid failing because of
minor inaccuracies introduced by floating point arithmetic.
