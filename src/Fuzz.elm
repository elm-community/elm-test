{-| This is a library of _fuzzers_ you can use to supply values to your fuzz
tests. You can typically pick out which ones you need according to their types.

A `Fuzzer a` knows how to create values of type `a` in two different ways. It
can create them randomly, so that your test's expectations are run against many
values. Fuzzers will often generate edge cases likely to find bugs. If the
fuzzer can make your test fail, it also knows how to "shrink" that failing input
into more minimal examples, some of which might also cause the tests to fail. In
this way, fuzzers can usually find the smallest or simplest input that
reproduces a bug.


## Common Fuzzers

@docs bool, int, intRange, float, floatRange, percentage, string, maybe, result, list, array


## Working with Fuzzers

@docs Fuzzer, constant, map, map2, map3, map4, map5, andMap, andThen, frequency, conditional
@docs Fuzzer, oneOf, constant, map, map2, map3, map4, map5, andMap, andThen, frequency, conditional


## Tuple Fuzzers

Instead of using a tuple, consider using `fuzzN`.

those values.

{-| Build a custom `Fuzzer a` by providing a `Generator a` and a `Shrinker a`.
Generators are defined in [`mgold/elm-random-pcg`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mgold/elm-random-pcg/latest),
which is not core's Random module but has a compatible interface. Shrinkers are
defined in [`elm-community/shrink`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/shrink/latest/).

{-| Create a new `Fuzzer` by providing a list of probabilistic weights to use
with other fuzzers.
For example, to create a `Fuzzer` that has a 1/4 chance of generating an int
between -1 and -100, and a 3/4 chance of generating one between 1 and 100,
you could do this:

    Fuzz.frequency
    [ ( 1, Fuzz.intRange -100 -1 )
    , ( 3, Fuzz.intRange 1 100 )
    ]

There are a few circumstances in which this function will return an invalid
fuzzer, which causes it to fail any test that uses it:

  - If you provide an empty list of frequencies
  - If any of the weights are less than 0
  - If the weights sum to 0

Be careful recursively using this fuzzer in its arguments. Often using `map`
is a better way to do what you want. If you are fuzzing a tree-like data
structure, you should include a depth limit so to avoid infinite recursion, like
so:

    type Tree
        = Leaf
        | Branch Tree Tree

    tree : Int -> Fuzzer Tree
    tree i =
        if i <= 0 then

       Recurse on all pairs created by substituting one element for any of its shrunken values.

       "No pairs sum to zero" is a pathological predicate that cannot be shrunken this way.
