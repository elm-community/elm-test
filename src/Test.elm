{-| Returns a [`Test`](#Test) that is "TODO" (not yet implemented). These tests
always fail, but test runners will only include them in their output if there
are no other failures.

These tests aren't meant to be committed to version control. Instead, use them
when you're brainstorming lots of tests you'd like to write, but you can't
implement them all at once. When you replace `todo` with a real test, you'll be
able to see if it fails without clutter from tests still not implemented. But,
unlike leaving yourself comments, you'll be prompted to implement these tests
because your suite will fail.

    describe "a new thing"
        [ todo "does what is expected in the common case"
        , todo "correctly handles an edge case I just thought of"
        ]

This functionality is similar to "pending" tests in other frameworks, except
that a TODO test is considered failing but a pending test often is not.

{-| Returns a [`Test`](#Test) that causes other tests to be skipped, and
only runs the given one.

Calls to `only` aren't meant to be committed to version control. Instead, use
them when you want to focus on getting a particular subset of your tests to pass.
If you use `only`, your entire test suite will fail, even if
each of the individual tests pass. This is to help avoid accidentally
committing a `only` to version control.

If you you use `only` on multiple tests, only those tests will run. If you
put a `only` inside another `only`, only the outermost `only`
will affect which tests gets run.

See also [`skip`](#skip). Note that `skip` takes precedence over `only`;
if you use a `skip` inside an `only`, it will still get skipped, and if you use
an `only` inside a `skip`, it will also get skipped.

{-| Take a function that produces a test, and calls it several (usually 100) times, using a randomly-generated input
from a [`Fuzzer`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/elm-test/latest/Fuzz) each time. This allows you to
test that a property that should always be true is indeed true under a wide variety of conditions. The function also
takes a string describing the test.

These are called "[fuzz tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing)" because of the randomness.
